To create the IDP and associate wit with the ROSA cluster, you need the following

* OpenShift Console URL
* OpenShift Authorization Callback URL
* A https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app[GitHub oAuth] application
* A GitHub Organization to associate with ROSA Cluster, which allows you to control who can access the cluster. If you don't have a GitHub organization yet, it is recommended to create one before proceeding further

Let's create GitHub oAuth App and associate it with ROSA Cluster,

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
rosa create idp --cluster=my-rosa-cluster --type=github --interactive

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

Any optional fields can be left empty and a default will be selected.
? Identity provider name: github-1
? Restrict to members of: organizations
? GitHub organizations: workspace7
? To use GitHub as an identity provider, you must first register the application:
  - Open the following URL:
    '<GitHub URL to create oAuth App>'
  - Click on 'Register application'
? Client ID: '<your client id from github oauth app>'
? Client Secret: [? for help] '<your client secret from github oauth app>'
? GitHub Enterprise Hostname (optional):
? Mapping method: claim
I: Configuring IDP for cluster 'kameshs-demos'
I: Identity Provider 'github-1' has been created.
   It will take up to 1 minute for this configuration to be enabled.
   To add cluster administrators, see 'rosa create user --help'.
   To login into the console, open https://console-openshift-console.apps.my-rosa-cluster.vlsn.p1.openshiftapps.com and click on github.
